I started <strong>programming</strong> <em>basic</em> at five, on a <em>sharp mz-700</em> connected to the TV set. At eight, my father bought our first <em>pc</em>, a <em>286 intel</em> processor. In <em>1992</em>, with the first modem, I was playing around with <em>gopher</em> and <em>bbs</em> set up in my friends' houses. The <em>www</em> exploded in 1994, and I started building web sites in <em>html 2</em> and <em>flash 4</em>. After fifteen years, I am still trying to find the right <strong>form</strong> to involve all of this, with style.

I have left many traces on the web. First of all, there is my inconceivable <strong>love for music</strong>: music <a href="http://myspace.com/megaafonia">I play</a>, music <a href="http://myspace.com/laherzio">I used to play</a>, music <a href="http://last.fm/user/claudiob">I listen to</a>, music <a href="http://last.fm/music/goremix/Live">I create</a>.
Then my passion <strong>underground railways</strong> and <strong>typography</strong>.
</p>
<p>
 There are plenty of <a href="http://neurain.com">thoughts I collected</a>, and nice <a href="http://www.straniviaggi.it">places I visited</a>. There are unforgettable <a href="http://tasteinmen.org">moments I lived</a>.
</p>
<p>There is my <a href="http://www.iiia.csic.es/~claudio">scientific research</a>, my <a href="http://www.iiia.csic.es/~claudio/papers/Baccigalupo-2009-PhdThesis.pdf">my Ph.D. thesis</a>, my <a href="http://github.com/claudiob">pieces of code</a> and also what <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22claudio+baccigalupo%22">Google says</a> about me.</p>
<p>And there is so much more left off-line that I will share with you, fellow stranger, the day we will meet.
