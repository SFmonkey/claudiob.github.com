<p>
<a href="http://www.boxoffice.es" title="Open boxoffice.es">Boxoffice.es</a> is the most popular web site I have delivered, with 25,000 monthly visits. The author needed a simple way to <strong>publish articles</strong> and reports on a daily basis. After evaluating different <em>cms</em> options, <strong>Wordpress</strong> was eventually determined as most adapt server-side component for the web site.</p>
<p>Another requirement by the customer was to have the look-and-feel of an <strong>online magazine</strong>, rather than that of a blog. This was accomplished by means of an original theme written in <em>php</em> right for this site. 
</p>
<img src="/images/{{page.title|downcase}}.png" alt="Screenshot of {{ page.name }}" />
<p>Currently, the site is being redesigned and its internal structure expanded. The author has expressed their desire to include linked references to each movie, studio, genre and year throughout their articles. This requires to modify the <em>mysql</em> database structure and the admin interface.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, I have developed <em>wp-taquilla</em>, a <strong>Wordpress plugin</strong> that improves the admin interface enabling users to add, manage and fill tables in the database directly from the browser.
  You can  <a href="http://github.com/claudiob/wp-taquilla" title="Link to GitHub code repository">download the source code</a> and install the plugin in your personal Wordpress installation to evaluate its advantages.
