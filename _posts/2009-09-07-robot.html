  In MySpace Music, every profile has a list of so-called <strong>friends</strong>, musicians that are an inspiration, a model, that one likes, or has played live with. Most profiles have <strong>too many</strong> friends, and it is hard to understands which ones are musically associated and which ones are not.</p>
<p>MySpace Robot is a Python script that, given a seed profile, <strong>ranks the list of friends</strong> based on their affinity with the seed artist. For instance, given the profile of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/milesdavis">Miles Davis</a>, MySpace Robot ranks higher friends like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ultimatecolemanhawkins">Coleman Hawkins</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shunsukefujita">Shunsuke Fujita</a> (Jazz) and lower friends like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bobdylan">Bob Dylan</a> (Rock).</p>

<p>The purpose of MySpace Robot is to uncover artists that are not very famous but are indeed associated. Shunsuke Fujita, for instance, is not very famous, but his music shares a <strong>strong affinity</strong> with jazz themes by Miles Davis. Therefore, MySpace users who like Miles Davis' music might enjoy his themes as well.</p>
<p>MySpace Robot automatically sends mail messages to MySpace profiles of musicians who are not relative friends but might enjoy each other's music.
The feedback received is later employed by MySpace Robot to improve its <strong>recommendation engine</strong> and help other MySpace users discover music they might like.</p>
