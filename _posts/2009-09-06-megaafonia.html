desc: I <strong>hacked the style sheet</strong> of the MySpace profile for the band I play in to offer a well-defined image of the group

  MySpace, programmers either love it or hate it.
  Unskilled people can change their profiles on a copy-and-paste basis without understanding a single line of code.
  Yet building a <strong>nice and functional design</strong> is a complex task, given the restrictions raised by MySpace about which
  <em>css</em> selectors can or cannot be used.
</p>
<p>
  Together with my lead singer and graphic designer Pedro Lu&iacute;s Mart&iacute;nez, I designed a custom style sheet for the MySpace
  profile of our pop band Megaafon&iacute;a. 
  Pedro decided the colour palette, font families and pictures while my work as a <strong>web engineer</strong> focused on the integration of every component in the structure of MySpace.

  With this work, I have learnt a lot about the differences between how <strong>programmers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> think about web pages. Designers are very imaginative and believe that everything they draw can be coded in a web page. Programmers know the limits of the web in terms of size, capacity, font availability, interaction design, accessibility. Only the combination of both worlds can give birth to the best web pages.

  This project keeps evolving as we are recording our second studio album and preparing the upcoming tour.
