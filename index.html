            <p>I could tell you one hundred stories from my last 31 years. 
        </p><p>I could recall my passion for <strong>cyberpunk</strong>, my disappointment for virtual reality, and how I envision a machine to help humans be more <strong>creative</strong>. 
        </p><p>I could explain how I feed both my rational and my emotional self, by means of <strong>coding</strong>, writing, speaking, presenting, loving and playing music. 
        </p><p>I could express my beliefs over <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, gay marriage, the role of <strong>bass</strong> guitar, <strong>typography</strong>, the color green and start-up companies. 
        </p><p>I could enumerate the <strong>languages</strong> that fit my mind, and those that do not. 
        </p><p>I could talk about my passion for the <strong>underground railways</strong>.
        </p><p>I could show you pictures of my rainbow <strong>hairstyles</strong>. 
        </p><p>I could explain the content of my <strong>Ph.D. thesis</strong>. 
        </p><p>I could overcome you with my <strong>music</strong> obsession. 
        </p><p>I could give you doubts, I could challenge you. 
        </p><p>And then, we should <strong>work</strong> together.
